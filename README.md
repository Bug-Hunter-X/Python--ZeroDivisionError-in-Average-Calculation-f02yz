This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: the `ZeroDivisionError` that can occur when calculating the average of a list of numbers.  The `bug.py` file contains the buggy code, which fails when given an empty list. The `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected version that handles the empty list case gracefully.  This example highlights the importance of input validation and error handling in robust Python programming.
